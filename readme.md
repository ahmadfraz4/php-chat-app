## Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate real-time chatting functionality without "websockets" implemented using PHP, AJAX, MySQL, and JavaScript. Users can register themselves, create dummy accounts, and engage in real-time conversations through a web interface.

## Installation Instructions
Import SQL File:

Locate the SQL file provided in the database folder.
Import this SQL file into your MySQL database management tool such as phpMyAdmin. This will create the necessary database schema and tables required for the project.
Setting up the Project:

Ensure you have a web server environment (e.g., Apache, Nginx) configured on your system.
Place the project files within the document root of your web server.
Configuring Database Connection:

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the project files are hosted.
You should see the homepage of the application.


## Usage Instructions
Registering a User:

Click on the "Register" link on the homepage.
Fill out the registration form with your details, including a fake email address.
Submit the form to create a new user account.
Creating Dummy Accounts:

Open two different web browsers (or browser tabs) to simulate two users.
Follow the registration process mentioned above for each browser, using different fake email addresses for each account.
Engaging in Real-Time Chat:

With both accounts registered and logged in, initiate a conversation from one browser.
You should see the message instantly appear in the chat window of the other browser, demonstrating real-time chatting functionality.

## Technologies Used
PHP: Backend scripting language for server-side logic.
MySQL: Relational database management system for storing user data and chat messages.
JavaScript: Client-side scripting language for interactive features and real-time updates.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the user interface.
Apache: Web server software for hosting the application.
